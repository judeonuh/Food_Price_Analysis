# Food Price Analysis

## Background
Agricultural markets are inherently volatile ‚Äî prices of food commodities fluctuate due to factors such as seasonality, transportation costs, supply chain inefficiencies, and regional demand differences.
For FarmyHub Naija LTD, an agritech startup, understanding these variations is crucial for:
- Setting competitive yet profitable prices for their products.
- Anticipating market changes and managing risk.
- Supporting farmers and vendors with fair and transparent pricing recommendations.
Currently, FarmyHub Naija LTD lacks a structured approach to analyzing historical and regional food price data. This project addresses that gap by developing a data-driven framework to monitor and interpret price movements.

## About the Dataset
- Source: National Bureau of Statistics, Nigeria.
- Format: CSV
- Key Fields: Date (Recording date of price), Food Item (Food Item Name), Outlet Type (Market type where food item is sold), State (Geographic location of market), Price (Item price in Nigerian Naira per Kg)
- N/B: Dataset was filtered to only capture food prices in Lagos, Ogun, and Oyo, as these were the target states for FarmyHub Naija LTD.

## Project Workflow
